          <p1>  One witness sees a woman throw herself in front of a bus - clearly suicide. 
            The other witness is Jack Reacher.
            And he sees what really happened - a man in grey hoodie and jeans, swift and silent as a shadow, 
            pushing the victim to her death, before grabbing her bag and sauntering away.
            Reacher follows the killer, not knowing that this was no random act of violence. </p1>
